# hf-provisioner-digitalocean

A 3rd party provisioner for HobbyFarm that provisions VMs into DigitalOcean

## Status

Alpha software

## Prerequisites

1. HobbyFarm Installation

As of this writing you need to be running a version of Gargantua that 
tracks changes that are not yet on `main`. Use `ebauman/gargantua:pr-154`
for now, until the changes that allow this provider to function are
in `main`.

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/hobbyfarm/hf-provisioner-digitalocean
cd hf-provisioner-digitalocean
helm install hf-provisioner-digitalocean ./chart/hf-provisioner-digitalocean
```

## Usage

1. Add a label to your Environment of `hobbyfarm.io/provisioner: digitalocean`
2. Add the following required values to `environment_specifics` and 
`template_mapping` on your Environment:
```yaml
...
spec:
  environment_specifics:
    region: nyc1 # any valid digitalocean region slug
    token_secret: do_secret # a secret with key of 'token' and value
    token: dop_v1_... # if you wanna put your secret in plaintext (dumb)
  template_mapping:
    your_template:
      image: ubuntu-20-04-x64 # any valid digitalocean image slug
      size: s-1vcpu-512mb-10gb # any valid digitalocean size slug
```
3. Optionally add any of the following config items to `environment_specifics` 
or `template_mapping`:
```yaml
backups: "false" # or "true"
ipv6: "false" # or "true" (not tested, YMMV)
monitoring: "false" # or "true" (not sure what this does)
private_networking: "false" # or "true" (not tested, YMMV)

# must be plaintext, not to exceed 64KiB (says DO docs)
user_data: "#cloud-config ..."
```

4. Provision VMs as you normally would.

## Theory

Two CRDs get created - Droplets and Keys. Keys track SSH Keys for Droplets. 

When a VM is created in Kubernetes, and its provider is set to `digitalocean`, 
this provider does the following:
1. Attaches a finalizer to the VM to make sure we can clean up when the VM deletes
2. Creates a secret with a newly generated SSH key in it
3. Creates a `Key` object with a DigitalOcean `KeyCreateRequest` in it
4. Creates a `Droplet` object with a DigitalOcean `DropletCreateRequest` in it
5. Picks up the `Key` object and calls DO's API to create the SSH Key
   6. puts the response in the `Key.Status` object
   7. modifies `VirtualMachine.Spec.SecretName` to point to where SSH key is
7. Picks up the `Droplet` object and calls DO's API to create the Droplet
   8. puts the response in the `Droplet.Status` object
9. Attaches finalizers to `Key` and `Droplet` objects ensuring they are
cleaned up in DigitalOcean before deleting them in K8s
10. Periodically re-syncs the `Droplet` object with DigitalOcean to get updates
about things like IPs, droplet status, etc.
11. Writes appropriate status items to `VirtualMachine.Status` so HobbyFarm 
can utilize the new VM.

May have missed something in the above, but that's the gist of it
